# Planning
## Goals
- create a cozy rpg game
- not very story driven more so environment driven
- explore places like caves, forests, towns, and cities

## Design Specs
- Grid based movement (probably not gonna worry about subpixel movement)
- 8x8 sprites (exceptions on epic stuff like multi block sprites)
- ECS (bevy most likely)

## Gameplay Systems (what's needed)
- Inventory
- Tilemap
- Building
- Movement
- Monster AI

## Features (what's fun?)
- exploration in a procedurally generated environment
- destructable terrain
- building
- inspectable text on random things (almost everything)

## Prototype
- [ ] Generate World
- [ ] Move Player around world
- [ ] Gather resources
- [ ] Craft resources into materials then into deployables
- [ ] Build with the deployables

## Ideas
- A flowing ocean with animated tiles?
- Fishing
